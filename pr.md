1. What did you like about this website?
Your website looks very clean! I love the theme and the car pictures are really cool.
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
One difference I noticed is that your header does not stick to the top of your page but mine does. It isn't important but 
it is just something I noticed.
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think your website has a better user experience. Your site is very appealing to the eye, and I enjoyed navigating it.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think my codebase is more maintainable only because your all.css file has over 4,500 lines of code which is a lot to keep up with.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
The code is well structured and organized because you keep all your CSS in the CSS folder and have your shared CSS in one file. The only problem I see again, is the all.css file.
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    N/A
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
Your site looks good on my PC. However, when I look at it on mobile devices or try to resize it turns almost nonsensical.
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes, the code has good naming and is sensibly organized.
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes, shared CSS is stored in a common folder which helps limit duplication. 
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
I love your site, but you should consider adding media queries, so it looks great on all platforms. On the PC though, it looks perfect. But, on any other platform it just doesn't hold up very well. Overall, a great job though!
